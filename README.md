# MEG_BCI_2020_Datatset

We have provided the MEG BCI dataset in three different file formats:

1. Fractal image file **(.fif)** files
2. MAT-file is the data file format MATLAB **(.mat)**
3. Brain Imaging Data Structure **(BIDS)** 

In this repository, we have provided Matlab scripts for the following tasks:

1. **(.fif)** files to extract the MEG BCI data in **(.mat)** format. 

2. **(.mat)** files to extract the motor and cognitive imagery features using common spatail patterns (CSP) algorithm. 

3. A script for single-trial MEG classification to produce the baseline results.
